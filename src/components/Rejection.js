          Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. After reviewing your application
          and Github profile, we recognize that you are indeed a "coding wizard".
          Unfortunately, we have concluded that you do not have actual magical abilities,
          which you must have to be admitted into Hogwarts.
